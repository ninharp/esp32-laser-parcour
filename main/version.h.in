/********************************************************************************************************************
 * Global Versioning Information Header
 * 
 * In this file you will find all relevant version information which could used in the whole application.
 * 
 * 
 * How to use?
 * 
 * To use this file you need to create a version.txt file in the root of your project
 * and add 2 lines of code into your root CMakeLists.txt
 * 
 * The version.txt file only must hold the version itself without additional tags
 * for example "1.0.0.0" as the only content of version.txt for version 1.0.0.0
 * 
 * The modifications in the CMakeLists.txt are descibed as follows
 * 
 * Before the call to the project(YOUR_PROJECT_NAME) macro of the ESP-IDF add the following line:
 * 
 * include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/tools/project.cmake)
 * 
 * And after the project(...) call add the call to the version bump function
 * 
 * dd_version_info()
 * 
 * Thats all, now on every build the version build part increases by one 
 * 
 * Globally there are a few defines specified for version information.
 * 
 * SDK_PROJECT                  The name of the application (set in root CMakeLists.txt file)
 * PROJECT_GIT_REV                      GIT reference string
 * PROJECT_GIT_TAG                      GIT tag (if assigned in GIT)
 * PROJECT_GIT_BRANCH                   GIT branch the build was compiled with
 * PROJECT_FULL_VERSION                 String representation of the version (w/o prefix)
 * PROJECT_FULL_VERSION_STRING          String representation of the version (including prefixes and the git rev)
 * PROJECT_FULL_VERSION_NAME            String representation of the project name with the QCX_FULL_VERSION as prefix
 * 
 * You can also create you own defines in the version.h.in template file.
 * There you can use the following placeholders:
 * (All placeholders must be in between @ characters)
 * 
 * PROJECT_NAME                     Assigned project name
 * PROJECT_VERSION_PREFIX           Prefix of the version string
 * PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR            Major of the version as integer
 * PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR            Minor of the version as integer
 * PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH            Patch level of the version as integer
 * PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK            Tweak level of the version as integer
 *
